# Weather App

## My Goal

Develop a iOS Weather App

Weather is a location-aware weather app. It will find out where you are in the world and query an open source weather service to retrieve the temperature and weather conditions. Also, you can change the city at the tap of a button. Want to know what it’s like in Victoria? Weather is here to help. 


## What I will create

I purpose a weather app using the Openweathermap weather API. The main page uses geo
location to bring up the users local weather. The user can use switch button to migrate to
screen and select new city. The intended Audience is anyone that is interested in the current
weather. By bringing up the app you get the current weather instantly.
